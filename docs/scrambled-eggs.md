This is a recipe that I had to find online ([*How to Make Scrambled Eggs
Recipe - Love and Lemons*](https://www.loveandlemons.com/scrambled-eggs-recipe/)). I do not like eggs so please have as much as
you'd like. To make this recipe, you will need to know how to whisk and
fry eggs. The recipe doesn't list any quantities, so you should also
have an idea of the how much you'll need based on what you want.
