This recipe is fairly simple. It's just sausage wrapped in a pancake.
There are still detailed instructions on how to prepare everything
though. Prior to starting, you should know how to use a microwave, and
how to clean dishes. Please clean the dishes...

- Pork Sausage

  - I would recommend 2-4 links (1 per pig in a blanket)

  - Only one is needed
