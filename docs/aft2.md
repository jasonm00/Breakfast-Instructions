This option, thankfully, isn't so bad, Armando. Our recipe won't too
much like the picture above, but the picture kind of gives us the gist.
To follow this recipe, you'll need to know how to operate a toaster oven
and slice up an avocado.

### Ingredients/Instruments

- French toast swirl bread
  - Located immediately to the left of the toaster oven
- Avocado
  - Located in the fruit basket next to the bread
- Margarine
  - Located in the fridge
- Sesame seeds
  - Located in the cabinet immediately to the right of the microwave
- Salt
  - Located on the counter immediately to the right of the stove
- Pepper
  - Located with the salt
- Cutting knife
  - Located behind the spices on the counter (immediately to the right of the stove)
- Cutting board
  - Located in the bottom cabinet immediately right of the oven
- Butter Knife
  - Located in the second leftmost drawer when looking at the family room
- Plate
  - Located in the cabinet directly to the right of the sink

### Instructions

1. Put 2 slices of bread onto the rack in the toaster oven
2. Set the toaster oven to "Toast"
3. Change the number of slices to 3

    *Note: I know you have 2 slices in the toaster oven, but trust me, you'll want to set the toaster oven to 3 slices. If you like your toast darker, you can set the number of slices to 4 or 5*

4. Press start
5. Place the avocado on the cutting board
6. Cut the avocado in half while leaving the pit intact

    *Note: You may think that it is common knowledge to leave the pit intact, but I have seen some people struggling to unnecessarily do it*

7. Cut the avocado halves into however many slices you would like
8. Season the Avocado with salt, pepper, and sesame seeds to taste
9. Take the toast out of the toaster oven

    *Note: Only take the toast out once it is finished toasting. Do not proceed with further instructions until the toast is done toasting.*

    *Caution: The toast and/or toaster oven may be hot.*

10. Put the toast on the plate
11. Spread the margarine onto the toast using the butter knife
12. Place the seasoned avocado slices onto the toast

You have just made avocado toast! Please clean up when done.
