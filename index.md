# How to Make Breakfast at My Apartment

Hello Mom and Armando! Sorry I cannot help you guys make breakfast this
morning... or any morning. I, unfortunately, have 8/9 am classes each
day of the week. Normally, I don't eat breakfast, but you're in luck; I
have bought some breakfast ingredients just for you! Armando, I know you
are vegan, so I bought some vegan options for you as well. Below, I have
prepared a set of 4 recipes (2 vegan). These instructions should be
sufficient for you guys to make breakfast this morning. Please text me
if you have any questions and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I
can.
